Skewed Class 
1. Label rare samples as 1
2. Draw True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, False Negative matrix
3. Calculate Precision and Recall, F1 Score

Note:
1. True Postive != # Positive in the sample
=> True Positive is tied to prediction, while '# Postive in the sample' is ground truth.

2. Precision != Accuracy
=> Precision is tied with True Positive (specfically for 'Label 1' classification), where 'Accuracy' do not different 'Label 1' or 'Label 0




Anomly Detection VS Supervised Learning
1. Anormly Problem usually comes from the dataset that is usually very skewed! (Not enough to learn characteristic of Positive Example)
2. The Anormlies could caused by various reasons (thus to have various characterisitcs). You could not easily generlize the knowledge you have learned from trainning examples.
