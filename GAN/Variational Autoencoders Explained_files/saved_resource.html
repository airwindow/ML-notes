The post that gives you the "gist" would be a lousy substitute for a research paper. Writing tutorials is valuable, and I've done lots of it myself. But its also a lot easier to tell someone how to do something than to justify and derive it from scratch. This comment is also just way too broad. There are very dense papers, say in theory. But that content would also be very difficult to spoon-feed in a tutorial. Then there are the high quality applications papers. And among these, the good ones tend to be exceptionally clear and easy to read.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more

Maybe some, but it's not the general trend. Take the batch normalization paper for example. The equations you need are even put in a box with a big square around it. Same is true for the GAN paper, the adversarial training paper. There are exceptions - getting all the implementations to replicate the DQN is actually hard, and they could have made that much clearer in a few ways. But it's also much harder to explain because there are so many essential implementation details (doesn't fit in 1-2 lines). If you really don't want to understand the paper and want the punch line it's not that hard to find in many/most of the good papers.</p><p>What the field really needs is more great textbooks. You don't learn math as an amateur or grade-school student by reading the primary literature. And perhaps it's not necessary for machine learning either. We're working on an effort to explain a good chunk of deep learning / machine learning clearly (and to teach MXNet at the same time) here:</p><p>Currently in 2nd week of development but moving

data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>I was confused about this too. This blog post does not seem to mention the key aspect that makes variational autoencoders work. I looked further and found a nice illustration about this in this article: <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1606.05908%3AL6x4NSvkC8MgNNElDgogAnfVzbI&amp;cuid=4341210" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908">https://arxiv.org/abs/1606....</a> (Figure 4). The point is to apply the reparametrization trick (yes I know the term is used in this blog post, but the author seem to have misinterpreted it since the reparametrization is not applied to learn the KL divergence, it is used for the reconstruction loss) which allows gradients to flow from the decoder to the encoder.</p><p>The idea is this, instead of sampling from the mean and standard deviation of the encoder sample from a unit gaussian. Then multiply with the mean and standard deviation form the encoder (which is a differentiable operation) to obtain the random sample. Now the encoder can be trained both with the reconstruction loss and KL divergence. The reconstruction loss will constrain the encoder to not only output unit gaussian values.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a

So what I get is that the encoder doesn't actually produce the latent variable, but instead produces the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution that we do sample from and then map it to image space. Right ?</p><p>What if I want to give the image to the encoder and get the latent variables themselves as the output ? I mean this learnt manifold plot, it is not actually plotting the data points based on the  latent variables? Correct ?

code and article. Your tf implementation is really helping me see things from both sides: paper to end-to-end VAE. You mentioned:</p><p>"A downside to the VAE is that it uses direct mean squared error instead of an adversarial network, so the network tends to produce more blurry images."</p><p>If you refer to the original paper, you will see that the L2 norm or mse as the decoder loss is a consequence of specifying the assumed distribution on the likelihood is normal. That is, for the expected log likelihood component of the loss function we see that the log prob is actually c*exp(k*(x-x*)^2) (the gaussian) where x is the generated and x* is the actual. The log likelihood of this probability is c + k(x-x*)^2 ~ (x-x*)^2 which is were the mse comes from. We could assume a Bernoulli distribution over x ( pixel on or off like black and white pixel images) and get a decoder loss like the cross entropy.</p><p>I just wanted to clarify it is not always the mse.</p><p>here is an example of a post that discusses cross entropy:<br><a

My only suggestion is to explain what variational means: since you start with image generation, I would expect you to introduce, at a certain point, the concept of autoencoder and expand it to the concept of variational autoencoder.</p><p>Secondly, I am genuinely surprised by the results you get after only 9 epochs: today I was playing with a regular convolutional autoencoder, just 5 layers or so, and it took me 5k iterations to get a decent quality. I'm pretty sure I cannot get that result after only 9 epochs! I looked into your code and maybe it is because you're using 500 hidden units (I'm using 30 in the smallest hidden layer). Also, the article you mention at the end, from jmetzen, takes about 60 epochs. Do you have tips on improving the training time?</p><p>Thanks again, cheers!</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden"

the latent variables evolves during training, for a large portion of input images the Gaussian (latent variable) with the highest response will be a different one after training compared to before training.<br>And the more or less random initial mapping of an image to the index of latent variable with largest response will change therefore.</p><p>And I think that this is not a problem.<br>In the end this behavior is exactly what you are looking for.<br>After training similar Images will generate the largest response in the same latent variable.<br>Dissimilar images will generate their

Yet I feel it  lacked a bit on key issues specifically related to VAEs over barebones AEs. Would have been nice to see not so much the reconstruction of the original samples (AEs can do this just fine) but generation of new ones by sampling the latent space. A bit on discussing how latent space dimensionalty affects the quality of newly-generated samples would have been a plus.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

Just what I needed.</p><p>I am making an AE to learn TensorFlow and Sonnet. While training it, I encountered the problem that in many training runs it would learn to output a constant regardless of the input. Then I made a new version using the VAE trick of sampling the encoding from a distribution that depends on the input. I achieved 95% accuracy on MNIST (predicting from the encoding) very fast, so it worked. But then I discovered that I had not added the KL divergence to the loss. I suppose this means the network will still be motivated to learn the means right, and also to narrow down the standard deviations according to confidence. Early during optimization the larger standard deviations will contribute to some exploration, I suppose (similarly to Simulated Annealing).</p><p>Disappointingly, adding in the KL divergence gave much poorer results, or at least not in the same short time. I think something may be wrong in my implementation. And maybe that more training time is needed. Update: It turned out I was, ehrm, calculating the KL divergence of the decoder output... Now the results make sense, but still the KL divergence term does not seem to improve the results. Even if it does not improve the encoding for classification, it still opens up for interpolation in encoding space etc.. And the KL divergence seems to be a bit out of scale, so scaling it appropriately in the loss may win back the high accuracy achieved using VAE without KL divergence normalization.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see

For instance when I build a PCA model I can save as .h5 file.  The model save as a set of parameters  can be sampled later  or be used for registration and so on.  I got the VAE code from GitHub, I trained  the model,  I got the result.  How can I used the model now?

post, so thank you! The one thing that would make the whole package a little better (i.e., post + code) would be to comment the code. That's easily the most frustrating thing I've noticed, looking through the many examples on GitHub and elsewhere; the code is hardly ever commented! Of course, it will get easier to interpret as I become more familiar with both python and the libraries (tensorflow, pytorch, etc.), but comments are such a standard part of coding practice that I'm really surprised to see so little commenting out there...
